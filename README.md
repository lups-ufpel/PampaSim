Hello @everyone, this project is a operating systems simulator to help students in the process of learning the procedures of execution of operating systems.

It intends to be didatic/academic, so it can help students understanding operating systems concepts. The open source characteristic provide to the user the possibility to explore the code as they desire.
The presentation's simplicity of the execution's procedures let the user watch the whole simulation scenario at a glance. Therefore, the details of the execution could be presented as long the user wants, so it can be simple and complex depending on the user desire.
